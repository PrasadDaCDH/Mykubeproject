Q)Docker and Kubernetes are both tools used in containerization, but they serve different purposes:

- **Docker**: Primarily focuses on creating, running, and managing containers on a single host. It packages applications and their dependencies into a container, making them portable and consistent across different environments.

- **Kubernetes**: An orchestration platform designed to manage and scale containerized applications across multiple hosts. It handles the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers across clusters of machines, providing features like load balancing, self-healing, and automated rollouts.

In short, Docker is for building and running containers, while Kubernetes is for managing containers at scale across multiple servers.
